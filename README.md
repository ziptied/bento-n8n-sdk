## Things to Know

### Security & Validation

1. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated for length, format, and security
2. **HTML Sanitization**: HTML content is automatically sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
3. **Email Validation**: Email addresses are validated using RFC-compliant regex patterns
4. **Secure Error Handling**: Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### Rate Limiting & Reliability

1. **Automatic Retries**: Failed requests are automatically retried with exponential backoff
2. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion
3. **Concurrent Requests**: Intelligent management of concurrent API requests
4. **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts prevent hanging requests

### Best Practices

1. **Credential Security**: Always use n8n's credential system - never hardcode API keys
2. **Error Handling**: Use n8n's "Continue on Fail" option for robust workflows
3. **Batch Operations**: For large datasets, consider using multiple smaller batches
4. **Testing**: Always test your workflows in a development environment first
